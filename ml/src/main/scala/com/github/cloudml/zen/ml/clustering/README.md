# LDA Highlights:
 * Industry strength scalability and efficiency

 * Support billions documents, 100s millions words, with tens of millions of topics

 * Support asymmetric Dirichlet prior over the document topic distributions ("Rethinking LDA: Why Priors Matters")

 * Support multiple gibbs sampling algorithms, SparseLDA, AliasLDA and LightLDA, while with a little bit difference in sampling formula decomposition
 
 * Support multiple graph partitioning strategies beyond that provided by GraphX, such as Degree-Based Hashing, Hybrid-Cut, Greedy strategy

 * Support duplicate topic merge

## Road map

 * Propose new proposal distribution in Hasting sampling that gets the sweat point between system performance and model convergence
