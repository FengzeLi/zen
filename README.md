## Zen

Zen aims to provide the largest scale and the most efficient machine learning platform on top of Spark, including but not limited to logistic regression, latent dirichilet allocation, factorization machines, and DNN.

Zen is based on Apache Spark, MLlib and GraphX, but with sophisticated optimizations and newly-added features to optimize and scale up the machine learning training. Zen is developed with the mind that a successful machine learning platform should and must combine both data insight, ml algorithm and system experience together.
